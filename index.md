# Digital Privacy & Security Guide
##### *Reconfigure & Voice of Domestic Workers*

### ***Who produced this guide?***
This guide was put together by a team of researchers at the University of Oxford and King’s College London, in collaboration with [Voice of Domestic Workers](https://www.thevoiceofdomesticworkers.com/), an education and support group run by and for migrant domestic workers and Migrants Organise, a grassroots platform where migrants and refugees organise for justice.

We produced the guide after five workshops with migrant domestic workers, where we discussed different threats to digital privacy and security and advice for staying safe.

### The purpose of this guide
We have written this guide to help migrant domestic workers in the UK and elsewhere to keep themselves safe and protect their privacy both online and offline. Privacy refers to how much others (such as the government, employers or even friends and family) can access information about you. We are also concerned with defending against “surveillance”, which is a word for close monitoring and observation by someone in power.

| Key term | |
| --- | --- |
| `Privacy` | How much information you want others (such as the government, employers or even friends and family) to know about you |
