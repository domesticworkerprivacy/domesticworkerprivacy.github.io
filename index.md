# Digital Privacy & Security Guide
##### *Reconfigure & Voice of Domestic Workers*

### ***Who produced this guide?***
This guide was put together by a team of researchers at the University of Oxford and King’s College London, in collaboration with [Voice of Domestic Workers](https://www.thevoiceofdomesticworkers.com/), an education and support group run by and for migrant domestic workers and Migrants Organise, a grassroots platform where migrants and refugees organise for justice.

We produced the guide after five workshops with migrant domestic workers, where we discussed different threats to digital privacy and security and advice for staying safe.

**Disclaimer:** This guide is intended to provide general information and is not a substitute for getting legal advice.

### The purpose of this guide
We have written this guide to help migrant domestic workers in the UK and elsewhere to keep themselves safe and protect their privacy both online and offline. Privacy refers to how much others (such as the government, employers or even friends and family) can access information about you. We are also concerned with defending against “surveillance”, which is a word for close monitoring and observation by someone in power.

| Key term | |
| --- | --- |
| `Privacy` | How much information you want others (such as the government, employers or even friends and family) to know about you |
| `Surveillance` | Close monitoring and observation by someone in power, such as the government or an employer |

Our guide starts with some general advice for staying safe online. The guide then focuses on three specific kinds of privacy threat: government surveillance; online scams and strangers; and employer monitoring. These are the threats that domestic workers identified and described to us in five online workshops in May-June 2021.

Each section includes a summary of the problem, practical steps you can take to defend yourself, and further resources. We conclude with calling for broader changes which should happen to keep domestic workers safe. This is because we do not think you should have to be responsible for worrying about your safety all the time: laws, technology and employment practices should be changed to create a fairer and safer world for domestic workers.

### General digital privacy and security advice
**1. Think before you click**
- Do not click on or download anything you don’t trust
- Be careful about giving personal information away

**2. Get comfortable with your site’s privacy settings**
You can check out these quick privacy guides for your favorite sites to understand which privacy options they have. Wherever possible, it is valuable to reduce how much information about you is public and accessible online. Sometimes these settings can be confusing; you don’t have to read all of these guides but you may find the links helpful to have. One way to make this easier is teaming up with a friend to check your privacy settings together.

**3. Take time to secure your accounts and devices**
- Make sure you have a **strong password** for your email accounts that you don't use anywhere else. If you’re worried about remembering lots of different passwords, you can use a [password manager](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/what-does-ncsc-think-password-managers).
  - Some websites let you add a second step when you log in to your account – this is known as ‘two-factor authentication’. This makes it harder for scammers to access your accounts. [Find out how to set up two-factor authentication](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/setting-two-factor-authentication-2fa) across services like Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Outlook and iTunes on the National Cyber Security Centre website.

- Consider using **antivirus software** on your laptop or phone, and if you already have it, make sure it is up to date to give you more protection.
- Check if your details have been shared online (the website Have I Been Pwned can help you [check whether your accounts have been put at risk](https://haveibeenpwned.com/).
- check if your website’s connection is secure (look for HTTPs lock icons in the browser address bar). Try to avoid visiting websites where HTTPs has not been enabled (that is, HTTP).
