# Digital Privacy & Security Guide
##### *Reconfigure & Voice of Domestic Workers*

### ***Who produced this guide?***
This guide was put together by a team of researchers at the University of Oxford and King’s College London, in collaboration with [Voice of Domestic Workers](https://www.thevoiceofdomesticworkers.com/), an education and support group run by and for migrant domestic workers and Migrants Organise, a grassroots platform where migrants and refugees organise for justice.

We produced the guide after five workshops with migrant domestic workers, where we discussed different threats to digital privacy and security and advice for staying safe.

**Disclaimer:** This guide is intended to provide general information and is not a substitute for getting legal advice. If you need advice on your individual situation, you should contact a solicitor or advice organisation, such as [Voice Of Domestic Workers](https://www.thevoiceofdomesticworkers.com/), [Kalayaan](http://www.kalayaan.org.uk/contact-us/), [Praxis](https://www.praxis.org.uk/get-help), [ASIRT](http://asirt.org.uk/), [Hackney Migrant Centre](https://hackneymigrantcentre.org.uk/drop-in/),

### ***The purpose of this guide***
We have written this guide to help migrant domestic workers in the UK and elsewhere to keep themselves safe and protect their privacy both online and offline. Privacy refers to how much others (such as the government, employers or even friends and family) can access information about you. We are also concerned with defending against “surveillance”, which is a word for close monitoring and observation by someone in power.

| Key term | |
| --- | --- |
| `Privacy` | How much information you want others (such as the government, employers or even friends and family) to know about you |
| `Surveillance` | Close monitoring and observation by someone in power, such as the government or an employer |

Our guide starts with some general advice for staying safe online. The guide then focuses on three specific kinds of privacy threat: government surveillance; online scams and strangers; and employer monitoring. These are the threats that domestic workers identified and described to us in five online workshops in May-June 2021.

Each section includes a summary of the problem, practical steps you can take to defend yourself, and further resources. We conclude with calling for broader changes which should happen to keep domestic workers safe. This is because we do not think you should have to be responsible for worrying about your safety all the time: laws, technology and employment practices should be changed to create a fairer and safer world for domestic workers.

## General digital privacy and security advice
**1. Think before you click**
- Do not click on or download anything you don’t trust
- Be careful about giving personal information away

**2. Get comfortable with your site’s privacy settings**
You can check out these quick privacy guides for your favorite sites to understand which privacy options they have. Wherever possible, it is valuable to reduce how much information about you is public and accessible online. Sometimes these settings can be confusing; you don’t have to read all of these guides but you may find the links helpful to have. One way to make this easier is teaming up with a friend to check your privacy settings together.

**3. Take time to secure your accounts and devices**
- Make sure you have a **strong password** for your email accounts that you don't use anywhere else. If you’re worried about remembering lots of different passwords, you can use a [password manager](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/what-does-ncsc-think-password-managers).
  - Some websites let you add a second step when you log in to your account – this is known as ‘two-factor authentication’. This makes it harder for scammers to access your accounts. [Find out how to set up two-factor authentication](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/setting-two-factor-authentication-2fa) across services like Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Outlook and iTunes on the National Cyber Security Centre website.

- Consider using **antivirus software** on your laptop or phone, and if you already have it, make sure it is up to date to give you more protection.
- Check if your details have been shared online (the website Have I Been Pwned can help you [check whether your accounts have been put at risk](https://haveibeenpwned.com/).
- check if your website’s connection is secure (look for HTTPs lock icons in the browser address bar). Try to avoid visiting websites where HTTPs has not been enabled (that is, HTTP).

## Immigration and Government Surveillance
### Problem
The UK’s ‘hostile environment’ can make life in the UK difficult and expensive, especially if you do not have indefinite leave to remain. Many workers reported a fear of government institutions, specifically the Home Office and the police, due to the power these structures have over the immigration status of workers. You might feel concern or confusion about your rights, from topics like accessing healthcare in the UK to seeking advice and protection from excessive policing.

### Practical advice
No matter your immigration status in the UK, your human rights matter! Here are some practical steps you can take:
- **Join an organisation** such as [Voice of Domestic Workers](https://www.thevoiceofdomesticworkers.com/), which can provide a sense of community as well as help you learn and mobilise on relevant issues.
- **Join a union** such as [Unite the Union](https://www.unitetheunion.org/) (one of the UK’s largest trade unions), which can offer advice and help you understand your legal rights at work. They can also communicate on your behalf with legal aid organisations and lawyers.
- **Make a note** of legal aid organisations or law centres in your area - the Law Centres Network can provide legal advice on immigration along with other concerns, such as employment, housing and healthcare.
- **Know your rights.** This can apply to a wide range of issues; for example, health, housing and employment. [Kalayaan](http://www.kalayaan.org.uk/contact-us/), a London-based charity for domestic workers, also suggests the following advice:
  - Keep a copy of your passport and Biometric Residence Permit (PRB) and give a copy to a trusted friend or relative.
  - Open an email account that your employer cannot access and give the password to a trusted friend.
  - Give the contact details of your employer and any support organisations that are helping you to your family in your country.
  - Do not keep large sums of money at home. Keep it in a safe place such as a bank or post office. Do not lend money to or borrow money from people you do not know very well.
  - If you are going alone to an employer’s home for a job interview, give the address and phone number to a friend or relative and tell them when you expect to be back.
  - Keep the numbers of people and organisations that you can call when you need help with you at all times – these could include your local police station, your solicitor, your friends, [Voice of Domestic Workers](https://www.thevoiceofdomesticworkers.com/), [Kalayaan](http://www.kalayaan.org.uk/contact-us/) and other support organisations.
  - Note that employers are not allowed to hold on to your passport or any of your other official documents, except if they are completing a right to work check, which should take no more than a day. If your employer is holding onto your passport without your agreement, they could be breaking the law.
